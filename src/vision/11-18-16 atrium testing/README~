Purpose: Use beacon_timer.cpp to get some pictures that have meaningful names for
	checking the accuracy of beacon.cpp so far, and possibly correcting the 
	calculated distance by some factor.

A set of four images share the same name. "NAME_img0x.jpg"

Images should be named in accordance with the knonw distance to the beacon and the 
	angle if required. Use commas to seperate decimal points.

Run these images through a beacon.cpp test directly and find how distance 
	or angle changes.

Plot the results and how true and calculated distances relate to find a 
	"distance correction factor" or function.
	
*Don't forget to update the "best guess" coordinates in main.cpp when testing.
